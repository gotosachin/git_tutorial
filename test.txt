Hi i am learning git

1. Install git on system
2. git init
3. git status
Make change in some of your file.
4.
    1. add all file
    git add .
    2. add specific file
    git add filename
5. git commit -m "commit message here. it will describe what changes you made in this commit."

Now we are ready to push our code to master. It may be possible that you have not created the remote repository yet.
Here there are 2 ways of creating repository:
    1. from CLI
    curl -u 'USERNAME' https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"repository_name"}'
    USERNAME: Its the username of your github account.
    name: its repository name
    description: Its optional and has description of your repo. It can be passed in key-value pair.



    2. From using browser. Its simple, just login in your github account and create repo.

The remote repo url will be like: https://github.com/gotosachin/git_tutorial.git

6. Add remote repo to your local branch
git remote add origin https://github.com/gotosachin/git_tutorial.git

if you already has remote branch you can simply clone it
git clone git remote add origin https://github.com/gotosachin/git_tutorial.git .

7. git push -u remote master
Note: It will ask your username and password if these credentials not configured in global config.
